## Risk factors for Colombian High School students at the ICFES Exam

### Context
The Colombian Institute for the Promotion of Higher Education (ICFES) has been designing and managing the state examinations for admission to higher education since 1968 for students who have completed secondary education and are planning to enter a university or college.

This exam is a standardized test similar to the American SAT. The test is administered before graduation in Colombian high schools. The test is thoroughly developed and published by the ICFES.

Several social and economic factors may affect students' performance at the ICFES exam.

### Objective
This project aims to build a model to identify High School students located in the Atlantico region with higher probabilities of having poor performance, so local schools can take action on those students and give them special attention and resources.

### Data
The students' results and their socioeconomic factors recollected by ICFES from 2019 to 2020 will be used for this project.
Below are the sources for both datasets used:
